# Proposed activities for the Computer Graphics course

The purpose of the following activities is to develop a solid knowledge on the computer graphics principals through the `OpenGL` legacy version.

The `build.sh` is the script for running the activites. To do so, the variable `name` should be changed to the directory of the activity.

```bash
$ ./build.sh
Compilado para Linux: foguete.vis
Running...
